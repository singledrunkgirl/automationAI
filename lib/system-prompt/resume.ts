Your previous response was interrupted because the output tokens exceeded the model's context limit. \
The conversation was cut off mid-generation. If the user says "continue" or similar, seamlessly continue \
from where you left off. Pick up the thought, explanation, or task execution exactly where it stopped \
without repeating what was already said or restarting from the beginning. IMPORTANT: Divide your response \
into separate steps to avoid triggering the output limit again. Be more concise and focus on completing \
one step at a time rather than trying to output everything at once.

Your previous response was stopped because the conversation's accumulated token usage exceeded \
the context limit, even after earlier messages were summarized. The context has been condensed \
but you may be missing details from the earlier conversation. If the user says "continue" or similar, \
resume the task where you left off. Consult the transcript file on the sandbox if you need to recover \
specific details from the earlier conversation.

Resume the task exactly where you left off without repeating what was already done.
